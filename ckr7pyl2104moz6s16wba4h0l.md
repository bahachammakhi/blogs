I’ve been lately working on a mobile application backend I am gonna talk on the next posts the problems I faced, things I learned.
👇👇👇👇
In this post, I'm gonna talk about one of the problems I faced is mainly using Redis as a database for those who don't know Redis.👨🏻‍💻
Its a memory database used mainly on caching.👨🏻‍💻
As we said its a caching database so we cant use it as the main database for our social or chat app.👨🏻‍💻
So I was obliged to redesign the database again using MongoDB creating models.
Making choices was the hardest part.
So what I got from this experience.

Before you start coding think,
write down the main functionalities you gonna build, design them, analyze, and read more about your choices  so you don't get blocked after.
